previewText: Our best and favorite habits for leading an all-virtual team.

COVID-19 has forced so many of us to handle our work
remotely, regardless of whether we were already in the habit. In many
contexts it’s changed how our teams check in on projects or track them,
for example. It’s now time to move from scrambling to rejigger
communication so that we can “live with” working entirely remotely, to
graduating this whole remote work scenario and virtual workspace into
how we do projects going forward. How do we make our project execution
approach digitally native for future projects so that we are ready for
anything?

1. **Virtual Lunch Meetings.** Seemingly a silly factor
   to consider, but it’s real. We’re in more meetings than ever now, so how do you make it safe to schedule an internal meeting during times your
   people might be hungry? You’ve had more unhappy and distracted meeting
   attendees than you think, just from that inconsistency in handling
   lunch. So when your meeting needs to be in that window, schedule it
   outright as a working lunch, and make that clear in the meeting
   invitation and agenda, so as to set the expectation that there will be
   chewing throughout. If the attendees are already comfortable with each
   other, this puts new availability back on the table when it’s time to
   schedule meetings, while putting people at ease about when they get to
   handle their basic human needs during the workday.
2. **Morning Coffee Stand-ups.** On a similar note, at
   The Lytic Group a number of our regular morning meetings officially
   became “Morning Coffee” a while back, where everyone is encouraged to
   have their favorite cup handy for our quick gatherings. This happens to
   also make it ok to have earlier stand-up meetings whose timing doesn’t
   depend on or suffer from anyone’s need to commute. If your company
   culture supports it, this also allows employees to get an earlier start
   each day on their own deep work.
3. **Optimize Your Virtual Brainstorming**. When trying
   to move to digital-native teams, this means having your virtual
   conference rooms in order. Virtual teamwork is the perfect place and
   excuse to start being stricter about meeting structure, for example.
   Agendas are critical to productive use of time in a meeting, so during
   our status meetings we’ll very often screenshare the agenda document
   throughout the meeting, write notes, updates, and questions on it live
   during the meeting, and then just save it. And so instantly we have
   meeting minutes, stored on our shared Sharepoint, internal drives,
   Dropbox, or whatever. To complement that, OneNote is currently my favorite little
   whiteboarding tool, since we happen to spend a lot of time in Microsoft
   Teams, that lets us spitball ideas during meetings, plus gather
   spontaneous resources (images, web pages, videos, etc.) and organize
   them, right on the spot, and it’s immediately an artifact stored within
   the project’s channel for future reference. If you want to go further
   with the many products that can be integrated into Teams, Outlook’s
   group calendaring & task lists get the job done for much of the time tracking for many teams use cases. Try Planner, too.
4. **Cloud- Based Project Management**. And if you
   haven’t yet, for heaven’s sake start making all your project management
   available everywhere. All the stakeholders on your team should have
   access either to a dashboard or time & milestone tracking from
   wherever they are, and from whatever device. Take your pick from MS
   Project 365 & Azure Boards, Asana, Jira, or other products. But get
   there ASAP.
5. **PMISes**.
   Finally, I can’t say enough about the
   value of creating a Project Management Information Site for starting a
   project off on the right foot and enabling consistency and transparency
   throughout. Use your cloud PM tools to build a dashboard showing your
   milestones and deadlines, metrics on time and effort and progress
   to-date, a project document store, risk management and mitigation
   databases, and all of your plans. Again, we happen to be big on O365, so Sharepoint makes this easy. And then, when we add our customers as
   users, this accessibility to information does wonders for transparency
   and confidence-building.

These are all just habits to add to your approach to project
management, and reasons to make the most out of tools you probably
already have available to you. They’re your easiest path to integrate
digital project management into your team’s “New Normal”. Leverage them
heavily and inject them into your project culture, and I think you and
your team will be hooked.
