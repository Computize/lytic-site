# This is a heading!

The large heading is useful for separating large sections.

## This is a smaller heading

This heading can be used to separate smaller sub-sections of the blog post.

### And this is an even smaller heading

Sub-headings for your sub-headings!

If I wanted to make some text **bold**, I can just add two asterisks (\*\*) before and after the target text.

I can make text _italic_ by placing underscores (\_) before and after the target text.

If I wanted to add a link, I would can point some plain text to a url like so: [Google](https://google.com). The human-readable text should be wrapped in square brackets and placed right next to the link, which should be wrapped in parenthesis

Lists:

1. Number lists are also simple.
2. Just place a number and a period before the text.
3. And the markdown will format it for you.

- The same applies to un-ordered or bullet lists.
- Use a dash and a space before the text.
- The markdown will take it from there
  - You can even make sub-lists.
    - With multiple levels of nesting.
